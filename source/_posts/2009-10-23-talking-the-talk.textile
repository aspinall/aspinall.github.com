title: Talking the talk ain't walking the walk
---
I was talking to a colleague yesterday about this blog and I realised that I am guilty of talking the talk without walking the walk! One of those people that says they are going to do something and you smile and roll your eyes, because you know it unlikely that they ever will.

Well all that is changing. My family and I are following one of our dreams and moving from Blighty to Brisbane. We've never even been to Australia and soon we will be residents there. Now our life is an adventure!

One of my personal ambitions is writing hence this blog. One day I would love to be writing a tech column for a magazine or newspaper, but for now I can self publish whatever I like right here, in my own little corner of cyberspace.

I have a laundry list of other things that I want to do before I die and I'm starting to tackle them one by one. Hopefully the new friends I make in Australia will know me as someone who _walks_ more than he _talks_!

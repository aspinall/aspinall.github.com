For some time, I've been wondering of the combination of Design Thinking, Lean Startup, and Agile are a recipe for success? To me, they seem to be complementary approaches, each targeting different aspects of product development but together providing a holistic path from concept to delivery. 

**Design Thinking** focuses on understanding user needs and creatively developing solutions. **Lean Startup** emphasizes building a minimum viable product (MVP) to test hypotheses and learn from customer feedback. **Agile Development** is about iterative product development, allowing for quick adjustments based on user feedback and changing requirements.

**Design Thinking** is the starting point. It's all about empathy for the user, identifying their problems, and brainstorming innovative solutions. It encourages a user-centric approach to problem-solving, aiming to understand the people you're designing for and develop products that genuinely meet their needs.

**Lean Startup** takes the insights and ideas generated from Design Thinking and applies a business model to them. It's about building a MVP to validate those ideas in the real world as quickly and efficiently as possible. This approach helps to avoid spending time and resources on products that customers don't want.

**Agile Development** then takes over for the actual creation of the product, following an iterative process that supports ongoing releases and refinements. Agile allows teams to adapt to changes quickly, based on continuous feedback from users tested through the Lean Startup's MVP. It emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and small, rapid releases.

In essence, **Design Thinking** helps you figure out the right thing to build, **Lean Startup** helps you build the right thing efficiently, and **Agile** helps you build it right. Together, I think they create a robust framework for delivering products that users will love, while minimizing waste and ensuring adaptability as you learn more about your users and the ever-changing market and technology landscape.

My experience grows from the bottom of this stack. I have over 20 years experience of Agile Development, about 5 years applying Lean Startup, and very limited experience with Design Thinking.

Over the coming months I will be reading ["Sprint" by Jake Knapp from Google Ventures](https://read.amazon.co.uk/kp/embed?asin=B017S92JUY&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_JNSSWYM8Y2BDSRWACP7S), which provides a practical guide to applying Design Thinking in short, effective cycles. I will also re-read ["The Lean Startup" by Eric Ries](https://read.amazon.co.uk/kp/embed?asin=B005PR422K&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_HGAY9PTN1YK3J1HNDWMY) and attempt to put these techniques into practice, both in my day job and my personal projects.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the last few weeks, I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> (and the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/spock/">Spock</a> <span class="caps">BDD</span> framework) on my current project at work, and after initially being reminded why I don&#8217;t like dynamic programming languages, I have to admit that I&#8217;m slowly being converted.</p>
<p>Those of you who know me (or have listened to the <a href="http://www.codingbynumbers.com/">podcast</a>) will know that I am not a big fan of dynamically typed programming languages. I like knowing the fact my code compiles makes some statement about it&#8217;s correctness. Obviously it doesn&#8217;t mean that your code is right, but at least stupid mistakes like typos in names are picked up by the compiler. I&#8217;ve always thought that people accept the compromise of dynamic typing a little too easily.</p>
<p>In the past I&#8217;ve used Groovy to script builds and deployments, but I&#8217;ve never really used it to write production code before. The reason I have turned to Groovy this time is beacuse I am building a framework that is to be used by a team of testers to write their automated tests. I need something that will allow me to take the Java code I have (which includes a simple <span class="caps">DSL</span>), hide all the boilerplate and remove as much punctuation as possible. I evaluated <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> and Groovy and much as I like Scala, I settled on Groovy for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Groovy 1.8 includes a new <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GroovyJSR/GEP+3+-+Command+Expression+based+DSL">Command Expression Syntax</a> that really lends itself to the <span class="caps">DSL</span> I have created.</li>
	<li>Groovy is already in use in the organisation.</li>
</ol>
<p>And really it came down to the second of those. Using Scala and the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/specs/">Specs</a> <span class="caps">BDD</span> framework I am pretty sure that I could create something very similar, but Groovy seems like the more natural fit for the organisation.</p>
<p>When I first started transitioning the codebase to Groovy I felt a lot of pain, which I have subsequently put down to my attempts to keep the static typing where I could. Things definitely got a lot easier when I jumped off the fence and planted myself firmly in the garden of dynamic typing!</p>
<p>Another benefit of coming off the fence is that the code has become a lot more concise and less distracting (than the equivalent Java code). For example,</p>
<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">T</span> <span class="n">retry</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kd">final</span> <span class="n">Callable</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">action</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div></notextile></p>
<p>became</p>
<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="n">def</span> <span class="nf">retry</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">action</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div></notextile></p>
<p>This example also shows how I&#8217;ve been able to eliminate the use of interfaces and classes as substitutes for closures (action is treated as a closure), and replace generics with dynamics.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not completely sold on the dynamic typing argument yet, but I&#8217;m certainly a lot less sceptical than I was a few weeks ago. Only time will tell whether I become completely comfortable with it!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My initial reaction to the announcements from this year&#8217;s JavaOne was one of sadness, since it&#8217;s clear that Oracle has sapped the pioneering spirit that made Sun special. Having had a few days to reflect on it though, I don&#8217;t think it is as bad as my gut reaction would have me believe.</p>
<p>Oracle obviously has a clear focus of it&#8217;s intent with Java. It has been through all of Sun&#8217;s projects like Captain Sensible, culling anything that does not align with their goals. I&#8217;m guessing that Java the platform is much more important to them than Java the language, since they&#8217;ve dropped JavaFX Script and the interesting language features from Java 7. It appears that they are happy for the likes of Groovy and Scala to continue innovating in that space.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not surprised that some key individuals left when Oracle took over if my interpretation is correct. It must have felt like the fun police arriving! On the whole though, I think Oracle&#8217;s ruthless business mindset will put Java on a steady course, which means it will be around for a very long time&#8230; I&#8217;m just not sure I&#8217;m all that interested anymore!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I attended <a href="http://www.meetup.com/barcampqld/">Barcamp Gold Coast IV</a> last weekend which was an awesome experience despite the low turn out. The lack of attendance did prompt me to host a couple of impromptu sessions though, one being a rehash of a blog post I wrote last year about <span class="caps">RIA</span> technologies and where I thought it was all heading.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing was that I conducted a quick straw poll at the start of the session to gauge feeling towards Flash, with surprising results. There were a mix of people in the audience, from accountants to developers, and <strong>every single one of them</strong> hated Flash! Some because of it&#8217;s use in advertising, some because it hogs resources on their system, but nobody wanted it on their system and some people were actively blocking Flash content from their browsers.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m no fan of Flash but I was not expected such a landslide result! Given that I already thought Flash was under threat from <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5, this lack of consumer enthusiasm for it has to be another nail in the coffin.</p>
<p>Since my last blog post, Google has also been successful in it&#8217;s acquisition of On2, the company from whom the Flash video codec is licensed. Google can now do what they want with that codec, such as open source it or freely license it to other browser vendors, subject to any contractual obligations On2 have with Adobe and Oracle (who license the same codec for JavaFX). Is that the sound of another nail being readied?</p>
<p>All told I think the developments of the last few months have been positive ones for internet consumers, since it should start to resolve some of the sticky issues with the <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5 specification process. But I think it is more bad news for Adobe who, sooner or later, are going to have to stop shoving the Flash runtime down people&#8217;s throats.</p>
<p>The only runtime people seem to want in their browsers now is the JavaScript runtime and between <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/whats-new.html#performance">Apple</a> and <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/JavaScript:TraceMonkey">Mozilla</a>, we have three great implementations competing against each other. If the <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5 committee can reach an agreement on which video format the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag must support, then I don&#8217;t see any reason left for any content provider to use Flash (or <a href="http://www.silverlight.net/">Silverlight</a> or <a href="http://www.javafx.com/">JavaFX</a>) at all.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With the impending move to Australia coming up I decided to rip all of our music and video to the computer and abandon physical media altogether. We have a few hundred CDs and over a hundred DVDs so it wasn&#8217;t a trivial nor insurmountable task to rip them all but the switch away from physical media raises a number of questions.</p>
<p>The first decision I had to make was which format and quality to use to rip our existing content. I&#8217;ve had a number of conversations with my dad over the last few years about the quality of the encoding versus the quality of the content. The argument basically boils down to this. If there&#8217;s a song or piece of music you really love, you&#8217;ll enjoy listening to it on an AM radio almost as much as you would from a CD. The same goes for your favourite film. You will enjoy watching it on an analogue 14&quot; TV from a <span class="caps">VCR</span> almost as much as on a 50&quot; <span class="caps">LED</span> backlit 1080p TV from a BluRay disc. The bottom line is that the quality of the content is the most important part of the equation because that&#8217;s where you derive the majority of the enjoyment. So long as the quality of the encoding is good enough, then very little of the enjoyment will be lost.</p>
<p>Whilst I would have liked to use the open source and patent free <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net/"><span class="caps">FLAC</span></a> or <a href="http://www.vorbis.com/">Vorbis</a> codecs to encode the audio, I also wanted to make it as easy as possible to play the files back on as wide a range of devices as possible. That really meant the only available choice was MP3, since <span class="caps">AAC</span> is probably better quality for the same size but is not as widely supported. As for quality, I chose 256kbps because I can&#8217;t really hear a difference between that and a CD whereas I sometimes can at 128kbps. With the DVDs, I would have liked to use H.264, but it took 4x longer to encode than standard <span class="caps">MPEG</span> 4, and there are still a lot of devices that don&#8217;t support it properly, so I opted for the latter. Ideologically I would have used <a href="http://theora.org/">Theora</a> (open source and patent free) but it is very poorly supported.</p>
<p>Having liberated all of our content from it&#8217;s physical medium, the ongoing challenge is to avoid acquiring any more physical media. With audio this is not too difficult, thanks to the likes of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/">Amazon MP3</a> and <a href="http://www.7digital.co.uk/">7Digital</a> offering high quality, <span class="caps">DRM</span> free MP3 downloads, or if you&#8217;re really pushed, iTunes <span class="caps">DRM</span> free <span class="caps">AAC</span> downloads. Video however is another matter.</p>
<p>Just as the music industry has recognized that the only way to beat piracy is to make it easier to buy their content than to steal it, the TV and movie industry start making all the same mistakes! I can&#8217;t find anywhere to legitimately download <span class="caps">DRM</span> free video content. The iTunes store offers the best choice, at least in the UK, but all the content is protected by Apple&#8217;s Fairplay <span class="caps">DRM</span>, which means I can&#8217;t play it on anything other than iTunes or Apple&#8217;s portable media products. <a href="http://www.tescoentertainment.com/store/browse/filmtvdownloads/">Tesco</a> and <a href="https://www.coolroom.com/">CoolRoom</a> also offer video download but only in <span class="caps">WMV</span> format protected by Microsoft&#8217;s PlaysForSure <span class="caps">DRM</span> technology that doesn&#8217;t work on Mac or iPods!</p>
<p>Case in point is the J. J. Abrams Star Trek movie that has just been released on <span class="caps">DVD</span> in the UK this week. I paid to watch this movie at the cinema and I enjoyed it so much I want to pay again to own a copy but I don&#8217;t want any physical media. My first port of call was the iTunes store who have it for &pound;10.99 including extras but with <span class="caps">DRM</span>. Next stop, Google. None of the top 10 Google results for &#8220;star trek movie download&#8221; were legitimate links. One of the sponsored links was <a href="http://www.findanyfilm.com/">FindAnyFilm</a> which lead me to CoolRoom where I can also download it for &pound;11.99 without the extras but with <span class="caps">DRM</span> that won&#8217;t work on anything I own!</p>
<p>The simplest way for me to get this movie would be to bittorrent it, and I would have the option of a HD version to boot. When will the movie industry realise that it is currently easier to pirate their product than it is to buy it legitimately, and that is why piracy is rife? Why are they making it so hard for us to give them our money? The best legitimate option I have is to buy it on <span class="caps">DVD</span> (&pound;8.00 from <a href="http://www.morrisons.co.uk/">Morrisons</a>), rip it straight to the computer and place the <span class="caps">DVD</span> in storage. That&#8217;s time and effort I would gladly pay an extra &pound;2.99 to avoid if they would just get rid of the stupid <span class="caps">DRM</span>!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since the news that Oracle was buying Sun, I&#8217;ve not been convinced about the future of JavaFX. In the last couple of months I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that it doesn&#8217;t matter what Sun or Oracle does with JavaFX, it&#8217;s future as an <span class="caps">RIA</span> technology looks pretty bleak anyway. And it&#8217;s not alone. Adobe Flash and Microsoft Silverlight are in the path of the same train that is starting to build up a head of steam, namely the combination of <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5, <span class="caps">CSS</span> 3 and JavaScript. Let&#8217;s take a look at the evidence and see why I have jumped to this conclusion!</p>
<p>Two of the biggest proponents of the <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5 and associated standards are Google and Apple. Let&#8217;s start by looking at their recent behaviour.</p>
<p>About a year ago, Google launched their Chrome browser with the express intent of creating a platform to deliver <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5 applications. A few months ago, they announced Chrome OS, a lightweight operating system whose whole user interface appears to be web based. The next release of their Android operating system for mobile devices is also going to feature a <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5 browser. Apple have also been making sure that <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5 support is in all their products. Version 4 of their desktop Safari browser supports <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5 as does Safari on the iPhone. So they are both doing their utmost to ensure that people can use <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5.</p>
<p>Google has been re-encoding all the YouTube content in H.264 instead of Flash video. <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5 includes a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element which will eventually mean that webpages can include video without the need for additional plugins, like Flash Player for example. Apple&#8217;s iPhone has special support for YouTube so that the H.264 encoded content can be played, again avoiding the need for a Flash plugin. Apple&#8217;s steadfast refusal to allow Flash on to the iPhone is creating a headache for Adobe, as the iPhone becomes ever more popular and web developers are forced to provide Flash free sites (or at least Flash free alternatives) to avoid losing potentially lucrative audiences.</p>
<p>The only thing slowing down the adoption of <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5 is bickering over the fine details. Everyone agrees that there should be a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag, but no-one can agree which codec(s) should be supported in the standard, meaning that all browsers will have to include them. Most of the arguments are over potential patent claims but the three lead contenders are H.264 (an <span class="caps">ITU</span>-T standard), Flash Video (proprietary) and Theora (open source). As well as re-encoding YouTube content, Google has also been trying to buy On2, the company that owns the Flash Video codec (also used as the cross platform codec in JavaFX). Sounds to me like they are hedging their bets!</p>
<p>So two of the most successful technology companies of this millennium would appear to be set on a course to rid the web of Adobe Flash and replace it with standards based <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5. If they are making headway against Adobe Flash then the relative minnows of JavaFX and Silverlight stand no chance. Fortunately Sun/Oracle and Microsoft don&#8217;t have as much to lose as Adobe, who generate a significant income from Flash related authoring tools. In my humble opinion, they already ought to be thinking about how to leverage their well known and respected tool chain to produce <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5 based solutions. I figure that&#8217;s their best bet to keep their existing customer base if Flash use starts to decline.</p>
<p>Sadly the same cannot be said for Sun and JavaFX. If it isn&#8217;t going to be used for RIAs, what else can it be used for? There&#8217;s set top boxes of course, but many of them already use <span class="caps">HTML</span> under the hood and <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5 will probably do most of what they want. BluRay is another possibility, but you&#8217;ve got to figure that the days of physical media are numbered. I think the best bet for JavaFX is as a replacement for the Java language itself. It&#8217;s a modern language with some really nice features and would be a worthy competitor to the likes of Scala as the &#8220;new&#8221; Java. Here&#8217;s hoping!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since the start of last week I have been using the beta release of <a href="http://jetbrains.org/">IntelliJ <span class="caps">IDEA</span> Community Edition</a> and I have to admit I&#8217;m really rather impressed. It hasn&#8217;t been completely plain sailing but I&#8217;m prepared to give it the benefit of the doubt given that it is still in beta and it&#8217;s only fair to expect a few hiccups along the way.</p>
<p>One of the things I like most about <span class="caps">IDEA</span> is it&#8217;s keyboard centric and code centric approach. To call it a glorified text editor is doing it a disservice, but the feeling I get when I&#8217;m using it takes me back to my first job using vi on HP-UX terminals to write software for telephony switches. I don&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s primitive, far from it, just that it gets back to basics and puts the emphasis back on writing code.</p>
<p>And yet it provides a tremendous amount of support. The code insight and refactorings are excellent. The inspections help keep you on the straight and narrow as far as good coding practice goes. It&#8217;s Maven and version control support is top notch too. The biggest problem is remembering all the keyboard shortcuts in the mammoth keymap.</p>
<p>The distraction free, code and keyboard centric approach means that it also works very well on my 13&quot; MacBook screen, and for the first time I can remember, I&#8217;m actually enjoying coding with it&#8217;s limited screen real estate!</p>
<p>In fact the only thing I&#8217;m missing from <a href="http://netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a> is auto closing a line when you enter a semicolon!</p>
<p>Will it sell more copies? I don&#8217;t know. As I said in my last post, there&#8217;s usually the best option and there&#8217;s the option that&#8217;s good enough. I think IntelliJ is probably the Apple of the Java <span class="caps">IDE</span> world, in that the attention to detail in <span class="caps">IDEA</span> is much better than Eclipse and NetBeans. But both those IDEs are good enough for the purposes of most developers. If IntelliJ ever make <span class="caps">IDEA</span> Ultimate Edition available for free then the others might be in serious trouble though.</p>
<p>If I were writing web apps every day, then I would definitely trial the Ultimate Edition and if the extra plugins are as good as the Community Edition, I would pay for it out of my own pocket, which is about as big an endorsement as I can give it! I&#8217;m also going to continue using it as my preferred Java <span class="caps">IDE</span>.</p>
<p>Having said all that I still doubt that this move will significantly increase it&#8217;s market. I hope I&#8217;m wrong, but in the current economic climate especially, people are going to be prepared to compromise!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Throughout our lives we are told to do our best. We would all like to buy the best clothes, phone, car or house. We all want our football, rugby or team to be the best, not to mention our kids! But life is also full of compromise, and sometimes we have to make do with whatever is good enough since the best inevitably costs more of something, be that money, time or effort. There&#8217;s also the possibility that you pay the additional cost unnecessarily because the &#8220;good enough&#8221; option would have met your needs.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the device I am using to write this post, the iPhone. I don&#8217;t even need to think about this one. As soon as I saw the first videos of it I knew I was going to buy one as soon as it came out. Two years later and I&#8217;m still using my first generation phone and I&#8217;ve yet to see another phone that is as well made or works as well as an iPhone. I&#8217;ve had my moneys worth out of it many times over. Even when I replace it with the latest model I&#8217;ll be keeping this one and using it as an iPod Touch.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m of a similar mind when it comes to computers. I haven&#8217;t seen another computer as beautifully made as an iMac or MacBook, although the lead over the competition is not as great as with the iPhone, especially with Windows 7 having just been released. I&#8217;ve been very happy with my Mac Mini and MacBook purchases and I think my next purchase will be an iMac, but I am by no means as certain as I am about my next phone!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also had bad experiences when accepting the compromise and not going for the best option available. I&#8217;ve struggled with my <span class="caps">DSLR</span> camera for months because I&#8217;ve been using some no-brand-name 2600mAh rechargeable AA cells that I was previously using with other cameras. The problem is that this camera draws a lot of current and the batteries just can&#8217;t cope. Plus if you leave them in the camera for more than a couple of days, they discharge so quickly that the camera isn&#8217;t ready to use when you pick it up and inevitably you miss the shot you were trying to capture. I&#8217;ve spent a small fortune on different batteries and chargers without any resolution to the problems. Finally I&#8217;ve given in and purchased some Duracell rechargeable batteries instead. So far they have been in the camera for 2 weeks and I haven&#8217;t had a single glitch, so this was clearly a case of false economy.</p>
<p>But the biggest decision of our lives has been to move to Australia. This is a complex multifaceted decision but at the heart of it lies a desire for the best possible life for our family. The cost is also multifaceted. We are leaving behind friends and family, some of whom we know we will never see again. There&#8217;s also a substantial financial cost on top of the emotional turmoil. We aren&#8217;t there yet and only time will tell whether the cost of leaving the UK, which is a more than good enough place to live, is a price worth paying.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a desktop Java developer, I have access to one of the best desktop user interface libraries around, <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/swing/">Java Swing</a>. Like it or loathe it, there isn&#8217;t a cross platform user interface library that even gets close to what Swing can achieve, both in terms of platform fidelity and custom components.</p>
<p>The biggest problem is that it is painful to use. It has a massive <span class="caps">API</span> which inevitably contains inconsistencies and leads to some pretty verbose code. In theory a good <span class="caps">GUI</span> editor should help ease the burden but I&#8217;ve never been a huge fan of them. Whilst they promise to save you from writing reams of code (by generating it for you instead) I&#8217;ve always found that somewhere along the way the tool screws up, and then you have to dig through all those reams of ugly machine generated code to fix the problem by hand.</p>
<p>That was until project <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/NBDemoGUIBuilder">Matisse</a>, the latest NetBeans <span class="caps">GUI</span> editor, came along. Now here is a tool that actually works. So far I have not had to duck under the covers to fix a problem it has made. It allows me to design the user interface quickly and easily, and then expose the components that I need to access from my controller code. So far, so good.</p>
<p>Except this week I&#8217;m evaluating <a href="http://jetbrains.org/">IntelliJ</a> <span class="caps">IDEA</span> instead of using <a href="http://netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a>. And Matisse uses a .form file to store meta data about the UI forms so it doesn&#8217;t have to infer from the code. That&#8217;s great whilst you stay within the walls of the NetBeans garden, but when you want to go play in the neighbour&#8217;s garden, the .form file can&#8217;t come with you. In fact, IDEA&#8217;s <span class="caps">GUI</span> builder has it&#8217;s own .form file that it incompatible with the NetBeans one!</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m back to being of the opinion that you should hand code your user interface and stay away from <span class="caps">GUI</span> builder tools, unless you are really prepared to be locked into a single toolset for the life of the product you are working on.</p>
<p>By way of an experiment, I converted one of the simpler application windows to use MigLayout, which promises much of the same magic that the GroupLayout does behind the smoke and mirrors of Matisse. It took me about an hour from start to finish but I now have the window behaving the way that I want it to, and with code that is reasonably easy to read, albeit still verbose (at least it is much less verbose than using GridBagLayout).</p>
<p>Whilst MigLayout  is definitely a compromise, it might just be the best compromise if you&#8217;re stuck with Java the language and have been bitten one too many times by so-called &#8220;helpful&#8221; <span class="caps">GUI</span> editors!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At long last, Google has released an official version of it&#8217;s Chrome browser for Mac OS X. It&#8217;s only a <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/eula_dev.html?dl=mac">developer preview</a> but that won&#8217;t stop me from making it my default browser! I&#8217;ve been using Chrome as my default browser on Windows for months and I really like it.</p>
<p>With the exception of Internet Explorer, the choice of browsers on Windows and Mac is now largely the same. As well as Google Chrome you have Safari, Firefox and Opera plus a slew of niche browsers. What I want from a browser is speed and standards compliance, plus a clean interface that doesn&#8217;t get in my way. Being a developer I&#8217;m more keyboard centric than most users and therefore I don&#8217;t like having to resort to the mouse unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Up until now, my preferred browser on the Mac has always been Safari. Whilst I use Firefox occasionally it is slower to start, slower to browse and slower to use because it&#8217;s interface is less slick than Safari. I&#8217;m not a plugin junkie so Firefox&#8217;s greatest strength against it&#8217;s competition does little to persuade me. I also found that it used to slow the rest of the system down although this seems less of a problem since V3.5. I like Safari because it is simple and fast, exactly the same reasons why I like Chrome. Except I like Chrome more!</p>
<p>There are a few features that really make Chrome stand out from the pack. First of all it is the fastest of the browsers that I use. The <a href="http://www2.webkit.org/perf/sunspider-0.9/sunspider.html">SunSpider</a> benchmarks show that Safari is about 30% slower than Chrome, and Firefox is over 150% slower!  The <a href="http://v8.googlecode.com/svn/data/benchmarks/v5/run.html">V8</a> benchmark tests confirm these results.</p>
<p>I built Chromium for the Mac a few months ago to try it out, and ran the SunSpider tests against Safari and Firefox too. Since then it appears that Chrome has gotten faster whilst both Safari and Firefox are going in the wrong direction! Both Safari and Chrome also score 100% on the <a href="http://acid3.acidtests.org/">Acid3</a> test (not surprising given that they are both WebKit based browsers) but Firefox is still lagging behind at 93%.</p>
<p>The second thing I think Chrome has got right is it&#8217;s implementation of tabs. I&#8217;m quite a heavy user of tabbed browsing and Chrome&#8217;s tab feel the most natural to use, and once I got over the initial shock of them invading the title bar area, I&#8217;ve grown to really appreciate them.</p>
<p>But the killer feature for me is the omnibox. One box into which you either type a <span class="caps">URL</span> or a search term. I don&#8217;t know what else you would expect from the search company that is famous for it&#8217;s minimal web search interface but in the very first releases the omnibox was a bit of a pain. You would enter a <span class="caps">URL</span> and it would incorrectly interpret it as a search term, but now it has lost it&#8217;s rough edges and it is the one thing I miss more than anything when I have to use another browser. There is no need to have a separate search box, either I know the <span class="caps">URL</span> I want or I don&#8217;t. If I don&#8217;t enter a recognizable <span class="caps">URL</span> then send it to a search engine for me automatically. All other browsers need to implement this feature as soon as possible if they are to stay in the game.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was talking to a colleague yesterday about this blog and I realised that I am guilty of talking the talk without walking the walk! One of those people that says they are going to do something and you smile and roll your eyes, because you know it unlikely that they ever will.</p>
<p>Well all that is changing. My family and I are following one of our dreams and moving from Blighty to Brisbane. We&#8217;ve never even been to Australia and soon we will be residents there. Now our life is an adventure!</p>
<p>One of my personal ambitions is writing hence this blog. One day I would love to be writing a tech column for a magazine or newspaper, but for now I can self publish whatever I like right here, in my own little corner of cyberspace.</p>
<p>I have a laundry list of other things that I want to do before I die and I&#8217;m starting to tackle them one by one. Hopefully the new friends I make in Australia will know me as someone who <em>walks</em> more than he <em>talks</em>!</p></div>

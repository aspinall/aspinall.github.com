  <div class="entry-content"><p>The cool kid, <a href="http://jetbrains.org/">IntelliJ <span class="caps">IDEA</span></a>, has finally come to play with the young upstarts, <a href="http://netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a> and <a href="http://eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>, in the free and open source Java <span class="caps">IDE</span> playground. This is great news but the big question is why now? And why has he left his most shiny toys at home? Is he going to be accepted? Will he be sent packing with a bloody nose? Here&#8217;s my initial thoughts.</p>
<p>Firstly, let me make some disclaimers:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Sadly, I have never used <span class="caps">IDEA</span> before. The last paid <span class="caps">IDE</span> I used was JBuilder 7 and since then I have always used Eclipse and NetBeans.</li>
	<li>I am not against paying for software. I&#8217;ll spend my own money and my employers money on software that does a job right for me.</li>
	<li>My day job involves mostly Java SE and Swing on the desktop.</li>
	<li>My day job also means that I work mostly in Windows and Mac OS X, but also in Linux and occasionally Solaris.</li>
	<li>At home, I only use a Mac.</li>
	<li>I&#8217;m not sold on massive plugins that do everything for you, at least not to begin with. I like to understand how things work so that I know what the plugin should do and can fix it if it goes wrong!</li>
</ol>
<p>Now I know that before this week I had never used <span class="caps">IDEA</span> but it is very highly rated by people whose opinion I respect. I have downloaded and installed it and will post again when I have been using it for a little while and have formed my own opinion of how it compares to NetBeans and Eclipse. For now I&#8217;m assuming that it offers more than both of these and I have to ask myself why JetBrains have open sourced <span class="caps">IDEA</span> now?</p>
<p>My gut reaction is that the commercial Java <span class="caps">IDE</span> market is dying. I suspect that <span class="caps">IDEA</span> sales are in decline and this is JetBrains last ditch effort to save <span class="caps">IDEA</span> as a commercial venture. NetBeans and Eclipse are more than â€˜good enough&#8217; for the majority of tasks that most Java developers face, so they have no need or desire to pay for an <span class="caps">IDE</span>, regardless of how good it may be. Listening to the <a href="http://javaposse.com/index.php?post_id=537909">Java Posse interview</a> with the <span class="caps">IDEA</span> evangelist, Roman Strobl, and lead developer, Dmitry Jemerov, JetBrains strategy is to win developers over with the free Community Edition and expect them to upgrade to the Ultimate Edition.</p>
<p>Will it work? My gut reaction is no, for several reasons.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Borland failed. <span class="caps">IDEA</span> may be better than JBuilder ever was (although to listen to <a href="http://joeracer.blogspot.com/">Joe Nuxoll</a> on the <a href="http://javaposse.com/">Java Posse</a> you would think it was the best Java application ever written!) but Borland was the king of developer tools and it was beaten by Microsoft and the open source alternatives.</li>
	<li>All the Java EE goodies haven&#8217;t been open sourced, and the majority of Java developers they are trying to appeal to will be writing Java EE applications. If they can&#8217;t switch over wholesale to the Community Edition, why should they even install it. Especially when the equivalent plugins are also free and open source for NetBeans and Eclipse. They can install the trial of the Ultimate Edition and use it for 30 days, but they can do that already and would have done so if they were so inclined.</li>
	<li>Personally I find it very irritating when software vendors carve up their products so the free (or inexpensive) version has almost enough functionality to be useful but not quite. I think <a href="http://adobe.com/">Adobe</a> has hit the sweet spot with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopelwin/">Photoshop Elements</a>. It has all the functionality that 80% of Photoshop customers need, and the remaining 20% have to buy the full version. For me, <span class="caps">IDEA</span> will probably do everything I want but I am probably in the minority and if it does, I have no need to upgrade anyway.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope I&#8217;m wrong and that JetBrains can continue to make money out of <span class="caps">IDEA</span>. Software doesn&#8217;t get that much respect without reason. If they can&#8217;t make money on <span class="caps">IDEA</span> I hope the make money on their other products because I would hate to see an innovative software vendor like them go out of business. I also hope that they fully open source <span class="caps">IDEA</span> if it doesn&#8217;t work out for them. Competition drives innovation and neither NetBeans or Eclipse wouldn&#8217;t be as good as they are if it wasn&#8217;t for <span class="caps">IDEA</span> leading the way.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>OK, I admit, I was wrong! Oracle are going to put their weight behind JavaFX and take the fight to Adobe and I&#8217;m glad they are because I think it is a superior technology.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also really pleased with what they have included in V1.2, primarily:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Proper UI components such as buttons and sliders and text boxes</li>
	<li>Cross platform support that includes Linux and Solaris (Microsoft might get away with supporting only Windows and Mac OS X and calling it cross platform but Sun can&#8217;t!)</li>
	<li>Better startup and runtime performance</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what the 1.0 release should have included but better late than never.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the main reasons Oracle is buying Sun is to get it&#8217;s hands on Java. Much of it&#8217;s middleware stack is Java based and having control of Java the language and the default implementation makes sense for them. I don&#8217;t really fear for Java or the <span class="caps">JVM</span>. If anything I think it will do better under Oracle&#8217;s stewardship than Sun&#8217;s, just because Oracle get things done. However, that also means that they will be prepared to do what Sun was not, kill off non-profitable areas of the business.</p>
<p>Java targets three markets: enterprise, desktop, and mobile/embedded. Two of those markets have historically received a lot of attention from Sun and have flourished, namely enterprise and mobile/embedded, whilst until recently the desktop market has been left languishing. Obviously Oracle&#8217;s main interest is in enterprise Java, that&#8217;s the bread and butter of it&#8217;s current business. I think Java&#8217;s ubiquity on mobile phones and the associated licensing revenue means that Oracle will see a viable business unit there and keep it running.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I don&#8217;t see how they are going to make money out of desktop Java. They can&#8217;t sell or license the technology, most of the best development tools are free and open source, and most enterprise UIs are heading more and more towards being browser based.</p>
<p>Sun&#8217;s decision to take on Adobe Flash with JavaFX has been driving improvements in whole desktop Java ecosystem. Whilst JavaFX has a lot more to offer than Flash because it runs on the <span class="caps">JVM</span>, the user experience is still has a long way to go before it even rivals Flash and Flash already plays very nicely with Java back end systems. meaning it can be used to provide compelling front end UI for Java enterprise systems already. I would be surprised if Oracle chose to continue fighting a battle that many people think was won by Adobe a long time ago.</p>
<p>The only saving grace for JavaFX might be as part of the mobile phone strategy (although that already has some excellent UI options such as <span class="caps">LWUIT</span>) or on the new battlefield that is emerging, televisions and set top boxes. I believe the next release of JavaFX will add the television profile, and at <span class="caps">NAB</span> this week, Adobe demo&#8217;d &#8220;Flash for Digital Home&#8221;. Here JavaFX might have a small head start, since every BluRay player already has a <span class="caps">JVM</span> capable of running JavaFX, a lot of set top boxes already run Java (I believe), and a lot of the TV manufacturers involved already have a relationship with Sun because they also manufacture mobile phone handsets (Sony, LG, Samsung etc.). Even if this saves JavaFX, it doesn&#8217;t mean they will keep it as a desktop technology.</p>
<p>The alternative is that they toss it out to the open source community, and whilst there is a lot of interest and enthusiasm, it&#8217;s never going to get gain traction without a major corporation behind it. I hope I&#8217;m wrong. I hope that Oracle keeps JavaFX and pushes it on the desktop as well as on TVs and phones. I wouldn&#8217;t go betting my mortgage on it though!</p></div>

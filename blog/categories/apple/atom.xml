    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have a dilemma. I love Apple products. I love the hardware. I love the software. I love the presentation. I love that their products are "friendly". But I also see an ugly side to Apple. The side that is cold, ruthless and oppressive.The side that decides what is good for it's customers and what isn't. Do I want to continue is a relationship with a partner that gives me beautiful things but makes all my decisions for me?</p>

<p>Alarm bells started ringing when Apple started making arbitrary decisions about approvals to the App Store. "Blocking Google Voice":http://techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/ was a big mental hurdle for me. Apple's excuse that it replicated functionality that already existed in the incumbent phone application seemed to be stretching the truth.</p>

<p>The next warning was "section 3.3.1":http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/iphone_agreement_bans_flash_compiler of the SDK license, which prevented anyone from using anything other than sanctioned programming languages to create applications for iOS devices. This sent them into a bitter war with Adobe. Apple had already refused to allow Flash into iOS, prompting Adobe to invest in cross compiling to native iOS devices. Almost antagonistically, Apple introduced the new restriction just before Adobe launched their new Creative Suite!</p>

<p>The latest slap in the face was the announcement to "drop support for Java":http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#releasenotes/Java/JavaSnowLeopardUpdate3LeopardUpdate8RN/NewandNoteworthy/NewandNoteworthy.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010380-CH4-SW1 from OS X 10.7. It felt like Apple was systematically removing anything but it's own technology from their system. Up until now, I liked being in Apple's walled garden because things just work there, but when the walls are closing in, it's time to find a way out!</p>

<p>There are some positive signs however. The restrictions in section 3.3.1 "have been relaxed":http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/09/09statement.html and Apple is going to "contribute to the OpenJDK effort":http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/11/12openjdk.html, which I think is definitely the "right thing" to do. The question is whether these concessions are just to lull us into a false sense of security before the next sucker punch, like the Mac App Store for example?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I started on my current project and got a new developer workstation, I took advantage of an official "Ubuntu":http://www.ubuntu.com/ distribution sanctioned for use within the company. Apart from a few wrinkles with the authentication against the Windows domains, it has been a real pleasure to use, so when I rebuilt my MacBook recently, I decided that I would use "Bootcamp":http://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/ and tri-boot it (Max OS X, Windows 7 and Linux).</p>

<p>I started out with the regular Ubuntu distribution, but it didn't seem to work all that well. It certainly wasn't a slick as it is on my workstation at work. I was having problems with the trackpad and the wifi adapter in particular. Then someone recommended "Linux Mint":http://www.linuxmint.com/, so I scrapped Ubuntu and installed that instead.</p>

<p>It installed straight away and everything aside from the iSight camera worked immediately. It can access the OS X and Windows 7 partitions and even the MP4 video and MP3 audio codecs were installed so I could play back my media from my iTunes library.</p>

<p>On top of that, it performs snappily and it still has the excellent package management of Ubuntu. I was even more pleasantly surprised when it paired with my iPhone and connected to the internet on the first attempt!</p>

<p>So if you've been thinking about giving Linux a whirl, then Linux Mint is a really good, low fuss candidate.</p>

    <id>http://www.craigaspinall.com/blog/2009/10/24/chrome-gleams-on-osx</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At long last, Google has released an official version of it's Chrome browser for Mac OS X. It's only a "developer preview":http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/eula_dev.html?dl=mac but that won't stop me from making it my default browser! I've been using Chrome as my default browser on Windows for months and I really like it.</p>

<p>With the exception of Internet Explorer, the choice of browsers on Windows and Mac is now largely the same. As well as Google Chrome you have Safari, Firefox and Opera plus a slew of niche browsers. What I want from a browser is speed and standards compliance, plus a clean interface that doesn't get in my way. Being a developer I'm more keyboard centric than most users and therefore I don't like having to resort to the mouse unnecessarily.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Up until now, my preferred browser on the Mac has always been Safari. Whilst I use Firefox occasionally it is slower to start, slower to browse and slower to use because it's interface is less slick than Safari. I'm not a plugin junkie so Firefox's greatest strength against it's competition does little to persuade me. I also found that it used to slow the rest of the system down although this seems less of a problem since V3.5. I like Safari because it is simple and fast, exactly the same reasons why I like Chrome. Except I like Chrome more!</p>

<p>There are a few features that really make Chrome stand out from the pack. First of all it is the fastest of the browsers that I use. The "SunSpider":http://www2.webkit.org/perf/sunspider-0.9/sunspider.html benchmarks show that Safari is about 30% slower than Chrome, and Firefox is over 150% slower!  The "V8":http://v8.googlecode.com/svn/data/benchmarks/v5/run.html benchmark tests confirm these results.</p>

<p>I built Chromium for the Mac a few months ago to try it out, and ran the SunSpider tests against Safari and Firefox too. Since then it appears that Chrome has gotten faster whilst both Safari and Firefox are going in the wrong direction! Both Safari and Chrome also score 100% on the "Acid3":http://acid3.acidtests.org/ test (not surprising given that they are both WebKit based browsers) but Firefox is still lagging behind at 93%.</p>

<p>The second thing I think Chrome has got right is it's implementation of tabs. I'm quite a heavy user of tabbed browsing and Chrome's tab feel the most natural to use, and once I got over the initial shock of them invading the title bar area, I've grown to really appreciate them.</p>

<p>But the killer feature for me is the omnibox. One box into which you either type a URL or a search term. I don't know what else you would expect from the search company that is famous for it's minimal web search interface but in the very first releases the omnibox was a bit of a pain. You would enter a URL and it would incorrectly interpret it as a search term, but now it has lost it's rough edges and it is the one thing I miss more than anything when I have to use another browser. There is no need to have a separate search box, either I know the URL I want or I don't. If I don't enter a recognizable URL then send it to a search engine for me automatically. All other browsers need to implement this feature as soon as possible if they are to stay in the game.</p>
